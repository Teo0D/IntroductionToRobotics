# Introduction To Robotics
The repo to be used during the Introduction to Robotics course.
# About the repo
Elective course taken during my third year studying at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bucharest.
I will be uploading each homework including requirements, implementation details, code and image files.
# Homework 2
Description: Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red,
Green, and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically,
you need to read the potentiometerâ€™s value with Arduino and then write a
mapped value to the LED pins.
