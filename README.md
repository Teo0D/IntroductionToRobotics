# Introduction To Robotics
The repo to be used during the Introduction to Robotics course.
# About the repo
Elective course taken during my third year studying at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bucharest.
I will be uploading each homework including requirements, implementation details, code and image files.
# Homework 2
Description: Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red,
Green, and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically,
you need to read the potentiometerâ€™s value with Arduino and then write a
mapped value to the LED pins.

# Homework 3
Description: This assignment involves simulating a 3-floor elevator control system using
LEDs, buttons, and a buzzer with Arduino. 
Contains:
- red led - blinks if elevator is moving
- white led - stays on while there is at least a level in the queue
- three yellow leds - on if the elevator is on that level
- three blue leds - show the state of the door on the level (on if open, off if closed)
- buzzer - only for opening or closing door.

# Homework 4
Description : This assignment involves a 7-segment display and a joystick. <br>
The initial position is: the dp led blinking, and all the others off. As the joystick moves, so should the blinking position.
With a short press of the joystick, the current led (blinking one) should change its state to the negative of its current one.
The current led should blink, its state not being important.
With a long press, everything will reset to the initial position. <br>
